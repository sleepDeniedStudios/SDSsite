      <h1>All Our Games</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Island</strong> - The first ever project created<br>This project never had a goal, it was just to explore the game engine.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Boxes</strong> - The follow up of Project Island<br>The goal is to create scripts that can carry over to other games we make, you could think of it as a template.</li>
        <li><strong>But Why</strong> - The first playable game created<br>Someone who's lost, whom words can't speak or express. Something deeply wrong in his eyes. With one question left unanswered.</li>
        <li><strong>Two</strong> - DISCONTINUED</li>
        <li><strong>Campfire</strong> - Second game<br>You're in the middle of a forest, with nothing but a campfire and an axe. The night has just begun and you'd rather not freeze to death. Keep the fire alive by collecting logs, but be careful. Some things only happen if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, the sunrise isn't the only thing waiting for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Centrum Oculum</strong> - The first huge and commercial game.<br>Coming.. not soon...</li>
